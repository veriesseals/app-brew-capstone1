    <h4>BOOKING CORRECTIONAL OFFICER (20012-20014)</h4>
    <p>As a county correctional officer, my responsibilities are to provide security, control and maintain the jail environment, laws and regulations for the inmates and other officers of the law.  Also we book or register inmates by computer or paper inmates brought to jail by other government agencies. Finally we transport juveniles and adult offenders from different agencies safely for judgment or housing for crimes potentially committed. The Booking process requires that the correctional officer assess the inmates crime and jurisdiction and set his or her court dates accordingly, so they will stand trail in front of the proper judge. We also serve indictments and warrants to offenders once highway patrol, county deputies and city police officers incarcerate them.  Occasionally other agencies of the law may require participation by the county jail to detain inmates for other facilities for transport to other facilities. The Booking correctional officer is key to the booking process with these procedures as well.
